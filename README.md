# Predict_StockPrice_IndianBanks
In todayâ€™s world, market clients want to invest and trade in stocks. As they want to invest in some good value stock, they need to find out the percentage of return and risk involved in stock as well as a good analysis of stock and predicted price for the next day for trade.

So we did some exploratory and descriptive analysis and then used Regression using Exponential Moving Average to predict returns and moving avg. of stock, risk, performance benchmark and predicted price of the stock.

The dataset used is confidencial as it was given to us by a company for our IPBA, IIM Indore final project.
